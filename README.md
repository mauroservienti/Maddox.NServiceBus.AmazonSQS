# NServiceBoXes.Endpoints.AmazonSQS

NServiceBoXes Endpoints simplify [NServiceBus endpoints](https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/) configuration by providing for supported transports a corresponding NServiceBoXes endpoint with sensible defaults. `NServiceBoXes.Endpoints.AmazonSQS` is the NServiceBoXes endpoint for the [NServiceBus AmamzonSQS transport](https://docs.particular.net/transports/sqs/).

Creating and starting an Amazon SQS endpoint is as easy as:

```csharp
var endpoint = new AmazonSqsEndpoint("my-endpoint");
var endpointInstance = await endpoint.Start();
```

## Microsoft configuration extension support

NServiceBoXes endpoints can be configured through the [`Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration). The above-presented Amazon SQS endpoint can be configured as follows:

```
Host.CreateDefaultBuilder()
    .UseNServiceBus(hostBuilderContext => new AmazonSqsEndpoint(hostBuilderContext.Configuration))
    .Build();
```

The endpoint will retrieve values from the `IConfiguration` object instance.

## Supported endpoints
